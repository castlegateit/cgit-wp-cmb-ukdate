# Castlegate IT WP CMB UK date fields #

Adds to the Custom Meta Boxes WP plugin by Human Made two new date fields supporting UK dates. Define a field as a UK date using the type 'UK_date', or a full timestamp using UK_datetime. Dates are stored as UNIX timestamps - use strtotime() in the front end.

Flexible date formats are due to be implemented in a future release of CMB, so this should only be a stopgap.

Requires the [Human Made Custom Meta Boxes plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes), natch.
