# Castlegate IT WP CMB UK date field #

Adds a custom date type supporting UK dates to the Custom Meta Boxes WP plugin by Human Made. Define a field as a UK date using the type 'UK_date'. Dates are stored in UNIX style yyyy-mm-dd format - use strtotime() in the front end.

Flexible date formats are due to be implemented in a future release of CMB, so this should only be a stopgap.

Requires the [Human Made Custom Meta Boxes plugin](https://github.com/humanmade/Custom-Meta-Boxes), natch.
